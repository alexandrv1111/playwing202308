3. PLAYER ANALYTICS SKILLS
You work for a game where there are several characters.
You are asked to analyse whether there is a link between the characters played and the fact of
continuing to play.
What KPIs do you propose to analyse?



1. 
Churn Rate by Character: Calculate the churn rate for each character to see if certain characters have higher or lower retention rates. Churn rate is the percentage of players who stop playing the game after choosing a specific character.

2.
Average Playtime by Character: Measure the average playtime per session for each character. This can indicate which characters are more engaging to players and keep them invested in the game.

3.
Character Popularity: Track the popularity of each character by analyzing how often they are chosen by new and existing players. This can help identify which characters have the strongest appeal.

4.
Character Switching Rate: Monitor how often players switch from one character to another. High switching rates might indicate that players are not satisfied with their initial character choice.

5.
Win Rate by Character: Analyze the win rate of each character to determine if certain characters are perceived as stronger or more enjoyable to play, which may influence player retention.

6.
In-Game Purchases by Character: Check if players who select specific characters are more likely to make in-game purchases. This can show if certain characters drive higher monetization.

7.
Social Interactions by Character: Evaluate social interactions between players in the game, such as forming teams or guilds based on character choices. Social connections can enhance player engagement and retention.

8.
Character Progression and Milestones: Analyze the progression rates and achievements of players using different characters. Characters that allow players to reach milestones faster may lead to increased retention.

9.
Feedback and Surveys: Gather direct feedback from players about their character preferences and the factors influencing their decision to continue playing the game.

10.
New Player Onboarding by Character: Evaluate the onboarding experience for new players selecting different characters. A smooth onboarding process can positively impact player retention.
